### Chainlink Oracles: SmartZip & ProspectNow

Subdivions is built with  hybrids on contracts that brings realestate data on chain with chain link Oracle. 
Once we've decided on a location for the subject division staff we can simply send it to the prospect now chain link or go node along with the specified payment. We can easily do that by connecting with meta mask. Currently it runs on the Kovan test network with a 0.00373 Kovan Eth transaction.

This can be viewed on etherscan since everything is automated and smart contract we can replace middle men like real estate agents lawyers registry fees title search and insurance and banks. We can use Subdivions to find the average price per square for the residential real estate for a New York zip code. Example: two premium data providers from chain link marketplace smarts it uses prices from SmartZip AVM model and Prospect now allows people to predict the average price per square put given a specific zip area code.

We can use ethereum remix to initialize or smart contract in addition to adding our chain link oracles with parameters like the owner name image description location price of our real estate assets.
